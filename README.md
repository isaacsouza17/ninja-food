## Why I used a full blown laravel project?

Beause Laravel (latest releases) now comes with Tailwind configured by default, you just have to run npm install && npm run watch to get it up and running... it can't get easier than that (as always Taylor doing all the hard work for us).

## How to run the project

Just follow the workflow below and you should be all set

(Assets are already compiled, so you just need to serve the damn thing)

```
composer install
php artisan serve
```

Access the URL provided to you followed by /ninja and you should get my "beautiful" food menu page.
