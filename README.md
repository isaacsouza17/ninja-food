## Why I used a full blown laravel project?

Beause Laravel (latest releases) now comes with Tailwind configured by default, you just have to run npm install && npm run watch to get it up and running.

TL;DR. It was just easier than setting up the whole thing manually (which is not hard at all by the way)

## How to run the project

Just follow the workflow below and you should be all set

```
composer install
npm install
npm run watch
php artisan serve
```

Access the URL provided to you followed by /ninja and you should get my "beautiful" food menu page.
